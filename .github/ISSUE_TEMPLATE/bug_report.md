In order to fix an issue, we need to be able to reproduce it. To give us the best chance of reproducing your issue, please follow these steps:

1. Please check that you currently have the latest mobile app version (2.6.9 as of Dec 3, 2019) installed. If not, please update.

In your issue, please include:

1. The version of Android or iOS that you are testing on.
2. The device that you are testing on (for example, iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy s9)
3. What you did. Example: “I navigate to Floating forests, click the “field guide” button, then click on one of the options.”
4. What you expected to happen. Example: “I expected the option to open with a detail screen.”
5. The actual behavior.  Example: “The app crashed.”
6. Please include, if relevant, what particular projects or workflows it is happening on.
7. Please include whether you were logged in or logged out, acting as a guest user. If the issue has to do with a particular project or workflow, please try logging in and out and see if the issue persists in both cases.
